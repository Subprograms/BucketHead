# BucketHead

**BucketHead** is a Python tool for detecting and exfiltrating from **publicly accessible AWS S3 buckets**. 

It merges MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1530, T1580, T1213.003, and T1552.001 
It takes either:
- an exact bucket name, or  
- a list of keywords to generate and brute-check likely bucket name permutations.

If a bucket is public, it downloads any listed files and scans `.txt` files for secrets like:
- passwords
- API keys
- tokens
- database strings
